	 <h1>Instructions</h1>
  <p>
  There is no need to change the look and feel of this site. No doubt, there will be one or two perfectionists that will find the urge to change a thing or ten irresistible. That's fine. Just remember, it's JavaScript you're being marked on, not your HTML / CSS skills. </p>
  <p>Your site will  be checked against IE6 &amp; 7, Safari and Firefox - so you do  need to focus heavily on cross-browser issues.</p>
  <p>You are required to add functionality, using javascript, to the existing site. The following is a list of suggestions only. You are free to come up with ideas of your own (provided they <span class="emph">are</span> your own). </p><div id="mark"> <span class="emph" id="note">Note: marking scale for this assessment - </span>
  <ul>
	<li>To Pass this assessment (AC) you must complete five listed code items <span class="emph">and</span> include:
		<ul>
			<li>Appropriate comments that show your understanding of the code</li>
			<li>A list of completed tasks in a separate text file in the root of your folder (see below).</li>
			<li>One script written out in pseudo-code i.e. plain English way of describing what you want this script to do before coding it into properly formatted javascript - refer to any of your DOM scripting exercises for an example.</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>To achieve a Credit pass (CC), you must complete seven listed code items plus the other items incldued above </li>
	<li>To achieve a Distinction (DC), you must complete nine listed code items plus the other items incldued above </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
  <p>As mentioned above, make sure you place appropriate comments in your code - <span class="emph">this is mandatory</span> - one of the competency elements requires technical documentation. This method is preferable to you having to write up an entirely new document explaining each script in painstaking detail.</p>
    <p>You must include a text file in your final submission listing the numbers and purpose of each of the scripts attempted. Also, if you include any scripts and features outside of this list, include their details in this file.</p>
  <p>Any code not written by yourself must be credited. Plugging in code written by someone else (other than a classmate) is fine. Just give the author credit, and justify why you used it.</p>
  <p>Image galleries can be as simple or as complicated as you choose. Remember that the main thing is the script works correctly, rather than its visual impact.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Validate the form on the contact.htm page. Ensure that all text has content, and that the content conforms to requirements (you decide and document what those requirements are). </li>
    <li>When the form has been validated, show an alert box that displays the data entered and asks the user if that data entered is correct. If yes, thank the visitor and submit the form. If no, prevent the form from submitting and display detailed error messages for the incorrect fields.</li>
    <li>Provide code for a Login feature. Once the user logs in successfully, every page of the site will display the user's login name, along with a link allowing them to logout at any time. You can achieve this by either utilising Ajax, or hardcoding a username and password into a basic JavaScript routine. You will need to use cookies to maintain a logged in state across all pages of the website.</li>
    <li> If the user has logged in, and they fill out the Enquiry form, automatically fill in the Name and Email fields when the user loads the contact.htm page (these can be hard-coded).</li>
    <li> Add the functionality to the reviews page that allows the user to select from a number of album reviews, so that they only need to see what they want to see. You can use any selection device you choose (e.g. combo box, list of links, table etc.). When the user selects an item, the title, picture and content of the review should change to match the selection.</li>
    <li> Add functionality to the featured artists on the index.htm page. When the user moves the mouse over one of the images, a brief description of the artist should appear. Moving the mouse off the image should make this description disappear.</li>
    <li> Add functionality that allows the user to enter the name of an artist into the search field in products.htm. As they type, a list of possible matches should appear. The user can select an item on the list to place it into the search textbox. You do not need to implement real-world search features (this would need to be done server-side, which is beyond the scope of this project), although you can build on this by implementing #8 below.</li>
    <li>Change the displayed product on product.htm when the user clicks on an item in the list. This can only be implemented if the item above has also been implemented (see #7).</li>
    <li>As an alternative to #7, dynamically build a table that contains a list of albums for an artist that a user enters into the search textbox. This would be done when the user clicks the search button. If there are no artists matching the entered term, a message informing the user that no artists have been found should be displayed in the page (not in an alert box).</li>
    <li>Create an image gallery that allows the user to move through a selection of 'recommended' artists. The user should be able to move backwards and forward through the selection.</li>
	    <li>Use javascript to disable the link in the current page. Make sure it is still obvious which page you are on. Currently it displays differently using css but is still clickable.</li>
    <li>Modify the index.htm page, so that the news items are listed by headline only. When a headline is selected, a story should open underneath it (moving all the other headlines down).</li>
    <li>Add functionality that automatically changes the &quot;featured artist&quot; images (without interaction from the user). If you attempt this one, make sure it doesn't interfere with any attempt you have made on #6.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As previously stated, this is not an exhaustive list. You are free to come up with your own ideas. You are not expected to attempt all of the above items (some are either/or scenarios in any case).</p>
